🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Platform Pitch Deck

Problem ❌ Global food demand is increasing while climate change reduces predictability.

Smallholder farmers lack access to reliable yield forecasting and monitoring tools.

Current solutions are fragmented, costly, or not farmer-friendly.

Solution ✅ A modern web-based platform that uses satellite data + machine learning to forecast maize yields with high accuracy.

Provides real-time crop health monitoring, rainfall integration, and early warnings.

User-friendly dashboards designed for farmers, cooperatives, and policymakers.

Product (Demo Screens / Mockups) 💻 Interactive dashboard showing:

Crop health maps (NDVI, SARVI, EVI, etc.)

Rainfall & production data overlays

Yield prediction outputs (GPR-based models)

Alerts and insights delivered in a simple, actionable format.

Target Market 🎯 Primary:

Farmers & cooperatives

Agribusiness companies

Governments (agriculture ministries)

Secondary:

NGOs, food security organizations

Crop insurance providers

Market Size 📊 Global agritech market: $25B+ (growing at 12% CAGR).

African agriculture digital services: $2.3B by 2030.

Kenya alone: 70% of population depends on farming — huge TAM.

Competitors 🏢 Climate FieldView (Bayer)

AgriEdge

Gro Intelligence

EOS Crop Monitoring

Competitive Advantage 🥇 Focused on maize yield prediction (major staple in Africa).

Localized models trained on African datasets (vs. global generalizations).

Affordable & farmer-first design (simple dashboards, SMS alerts).

Rich vegetation indices toolkit integrated in one platform.

Traction & Roadmap 🚀 ✅ Prototype of maize yield prediction completed.

✅ Initial testing on satellite datasets (EVI, NDVI).

Next 6–12 months:

Integrate rainfall datasets + local farmer trials.

Pilot program with 200 farmers.

Partnerships with agricultural NGOs.

Business / Revenue Model 💵 Freemium model: Free basic monitoring, paid advanced analytics.

Subscription plans: Monthly/yearly for farmers, agribusinesses.

Enterprise contracts: Governments, NGOs, and crop insurers.

Go-to-Market Strategy 📈 Launch pilot in Kenya & East Africa (maize-heavy regions).

Partner with agricultural cooperatives & NGOs to onboard farmers.

Localize for other crops & regions → expand to Africa-wide.

Our Ask 💰 Seeking $500,000 seed funding to:

Scale ML models & cloud infrastructure

Build mobile app + SMS integration

Fund farmer pilot programs & marketing

Target runway: 18 months.

The Team 👥 You (Founder) – IT + Agriculture Tech background

Data Scientist – ML & satellite imaging expertise

Agronomist – Domain expert in maize & crop health

Advisor – Investor or NGO partner in agri-tech

✨ Design Tip for Investor Appeal:

Use your chosen green-earth palette (#4A7C59, #8FBC8F, #228B22).

Insert mockup dashboards of your platform (even simple Figma screens).

Add charts for market size & competitors → investors love visuals.

Keep text minimal → tell the story verbally + visually. 🖥️ Frontend (User Interface)

Frameworks/Tools: React.js / Vue.js (modern, responsive) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Features:

Interactive Dashboard → Shows crop health, yield predictions, rainfall overlays.

Map Visualizations → Leaflet.js or Mapbox for rendering satellite maps and vegetation indices.

Charts & Analytics → Recharts, D3.js, or Chart.js for yield graphs & performance metrics.

Alerts & Notifications → Popups, SMS/Email integration for farmer alerts.

Mobile-first Design → Responsive layout for farmers using smartphones.

👉 The frontend is the face of your platform — clean, intuitive, and farmer/policymaker friendly.

⚙️ Backend (Core Logic + API Layer)

Frameworks/Tools: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI/Django REST).

Responsibilities:

Manage user accounts & authentication (farmers, NGOs, gov’t).

Process satellite imagery requests (send to ML models).

Compute vegetation indices (NDVI, SARVI, EVI, etc.).

Integrate rainfall & production datasets into predictive models.

Trigger alerts (email/SMS) when anomalies or risks are detected.

Store results (predicted yield, crop health scores, rainfall stats).

👉 The backend is the engine — where satellite data + machine learning models meet to produce insights.

🔗 APIs (Data Integration & Services)

Satellite Data APIs

Sentinel Hub API or Google Earth Engine (GEE) → for NDVI, EVI, rainfall data.

NASA POWER API → historical + current climate data.

Copernicus Climate Data Store → precipitation & soil data.

Machine Learning API

Custom API for GPR (Gaussian Process Regression) yield models.

Deployed via Flask/FastAPI or TensorFlow Serving.

Accepts inputs (NDVI, rainfall, soil moisture) → returns predicted yield.

Farmer Interaction APIs

Twilio API → SMS alerts for yield warnings.

Firebase Cloud Messaging → push notifications for mobile users.

👉 APIs make the platform data-rich and interactive — pulling from satellites, climate datasets, and pushing insights to farmers.

🗄️ Database (Storage Layer)

Database Engine: MySQL / PostgreSQL (structured) + MongoDB (for unstructured satellite metadata).

Structure:

Users Table → farmers, agribusinesses, NGOs, government officials.

Fields Data Table → farmer ID, location (lat/long), crop type.

Satellite Data Table → vegetation indices (NDVI, SARVI, etc.) by date.

Rainfall/Climate Data Table → precipitation, temperature records.

Predictions Table → yield forecasts, health scores, risk alerts.

Alerts Table → SMS/email alert logs.

👉 The database ensures data is organized, queryable, and scalable for millions of farmers.

🔮 How it all works (Workflow Example)

Farmer/NGO logs into dashboard (Frontend → Backend).

Farmer selects field location → Backend queries satellite APIs for vegetation indices.

Backend fetches rainfall data → stores in DB.

Data sent to ML prediction API → returns maize yield forecast.

Prediction + visualizations displayed on dashboard (frontend).

If crop health is poor → alert sent via SMS API.
